# Face-Generation
In this project, I defined and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. This project is part of the deep learning nanodegree program at udacity.    Overview The project is broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. And visualize the results of trained Generator generated samples that look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
